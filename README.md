# college_project
This Project was developed with C#, ADO.NET and MySql by me that represents a simple system for storing some information for a hospital to be more specific: surgery section of a hospital

for running the project you need to have visusal studio and the following extensions:
1_Mysql
2_ .NET Framework

default user and pswd for admin is : admin
I highly recommend you to look at the Form1 to get the idea of the security levels and layers.
